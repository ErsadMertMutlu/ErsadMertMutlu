					How To Open: 

	1-Probably, you don't have MatLab compiler toolbox. So you need to install it 
	where is in for_redistribution file. The size of the file is 707 mb. It can be 
	bigger now. 

	2-There is a shortcut. After installing, you can open it. If it is not working
	open the for_redistribution_files_only and start the .exe file. 
	
	3-This project is a simple project that I prepared. I hope, you can understand
	the differences of equations of state.
